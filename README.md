# Market-Basket-Analysis
Retailer utilize market basket analysis, a data mining approach, to boost sales by better understanding client buying patterns. 
Large data setsm such as purchase histories, must be analyzed to identify product groups and items that are most likely to be bought together.

The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm in data mining and machine learning, specifically used for association rule learning over transactional databases. It was proposed by Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami in 1993. The primary goal of the Apriori algorithm is to discover interesting relationships (associations) between items in large datasets.

Here's a basic overview of how the Apriori algorithm works:

1. Itemset: An itemset is a collection of one or more items. In the context of market basket analysis, each transaction consists of a set of items (products).

2. Support: The support of an itemset is the proportion of transactions in the dataset that contain the itemset. It is a measure of how frequently the itemset appears in the dataset.

3. Frequent Itemset: An itemset is considered "frequent" if its support is greater than or equal to a specified minimum support threshold.

4. Association Rule: An association rule is an implication expression of the form "If itemset A is present, then itemset B is likely to be present as well." Each rule consists of an antecedent (A) and a consequent (B).

5. Confidence: The confidence of a rule is a measure of the likelihood that the rule holds. It is defined as the support of the combined itemset (A âˆª B) divided by the support of the antecedent (A).

6. Lift: Confidence/Support A lift value greater than 1 indicate that association between two items is stronger than expected.

The Apriori algorithm uses a level-wise search strategy to discover frequent itemsets. It starts by finding individual items with support greater than the minimum support threshold and then iteratively extends the itemsets to include more items, stopping when no further extensions meet the minimum support criterion.

Here's a simplified step-by-step representation of the Apriori algorithm:

1. Generate frequent 1-itemsets: Identify individual items with support greater than the minimum support threshold.
2. Generate frequent 2-itemsets: Create candidate 2-itemsets by combining frequent 1-itemsets. Prune itemsets that do not meet the minimum support threshold.
3. Generate frequent 3-itemsets: Repeat the process for 3-itemsets and so on.
4. Generate association rules: Based on the frequent itemsets, generate association rules and calculate their confidence.
The Apriori algorithm is widely used for market basket analysis, where it helps identify patterns of co-occurrence of items in transactions. It has applications in recommendation systems, cross-selling strategies, and more. The algorithm's name, "Apriori," is derived from the Latin phrase "a priori," meaning "from the former" or "from the earlier." It reflects the algorithm's strategy of using prior knowledge about itemset frequencies to efficiently find frequent itemsets.
